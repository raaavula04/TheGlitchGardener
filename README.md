# 🦠 The Glitch Gardener

> **"Don't fix the system. Cook it."**

**The Glitch Gardener** is a reverse-bullet-survivor game set on a chaotic Windows 95 desktop. You don't play as the hero defending the computer—you play as the **Virus**.

Developed solo by **Studio Raaav** for the **Brainwave 2.0 Game Jam**.

## 🎮 Gameplay Loop & Objective
The genre is usually about defending yourself, but here, you are the threat.
* **The Goal:** **Survive for 2 Minutes 30 Seconds.**
* **The Win Condition:** Stay alive until the timer hits `00:00` to successfully crash the system (Blue Screen of Death).
* **The Lose Condition:** If your **System Integrity (Health)** reaches **0%** before the timer runs out, the Antivirus deletes you. Game Over.

## 🎨 Jam Themes Implemented

This game was built to fit specific themes provided during the offline round:

### 1. ⏳ "The End is Near"
* **Interpretation:** Usually, a countdown signifies a "Game Over" or failure. In *The Glitch Gardener*, the end of the timer is your **Victory Condition**.
* **Implementation:** As the clock ticks down, the environment becomes more hostile, lights turn red, and the music accelerates. You are racing *towards* the end.

### 2. 👾 "Glitches are Intentional"
* **Interpretation:** Instead of bugs being annoying errors, they are features.
* **Implementation:**
    * **System Lag Zone:** A weaponized glitch that drops FPS (intentionally) to slow down enemies by 75%.
    * **Pop-up Blockers:** Used as physical shields to block Antivirus attacks.
